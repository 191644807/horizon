# Fusion Extension Examples

We decided it was important to leverage Fusion alongside all your normal app functions. Here are some basic examples of how one would extend your JS web framework of choice with Fusion:  [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express), [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa), or [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs) frameworks with Fusion.
