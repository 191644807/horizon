# Horizon Extension Examples

We decided it was important to leverage Horizon alongside all your normal app functions. Here are some basic examples of how one would extend your JS web framework of choice with Horizon:  [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express), [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa), or [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs) frameworks with Horizon.
