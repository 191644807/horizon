> **At the moment you need the not-yet-released version 2.3 of RethinkDB due out at the end of the first week of April. Here are Linux and OSX statically-compiled pre-release binaries so you can still get started with Horizon. Make sure the binary takes precedence over your system installed RethinkDB in your path and you will be fine! Otherwise contact @dalanmiller in the RethinkDB #horizon slack channel**

# Getting Started with Horizon

* [Intro to the Horizon Client Library](#)

## Installation

First, install horizon from npm:

```sh
$ npm install -g horizon
```

### Creating your first app

Now you can initialize a new horizon project:

```sh
$ hz init example-app
```

This will create a directory with the following files:

```sh
$ tree -aF example-app/
example-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ .hzconfig
â””â”€â”€ src/
```

The `dist` directory is where you should output your static
files. Horizon doesn't have any opinions about what front-end build
system you use, just that the files to serve end up in `dist`. Your
source files would go into `src` but that's just a convention.
Horizon doesn't touch anything in `src`.

If you want, you can `npm init` or `bower init` in the `example-app`
directory to set up dependencies etc.

`.hzconfig` is a [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) configuration file where you can set all the different options for Horizon Server. [Read more about available configuration options here](/client/README.md#--hzconfig--file).

By default, horizon creates a basic `index.html` to serve so you can verify everything is working:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <script src="/horizon/horizon.js"></script>
    <script>
      var horizon = Horizon();
      horizon.onConnected(function() {
        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = 'It works!'
      });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
   <marquee><h1></h1></marquee>
  </body>
</html>
```


### The Horizon Client Library

In the boilerplate created by `hz init`, you can see that the Horizon client library is being imported from Horizon Server.


```html
...
<head>
  ...
  <script src="/horizon/horizon.js"></script>
</head>
...
```

After this script is loaded, you can connect to your running instance of Horizon Server.


```js
const horizon = Horizon();
```

From here you can start to interact with Horizon collections. Having `--dev` mode enabled on the Horizon Server creates collections and indexes automatically so you can get your application setup with as little hassle as possible.

> **Note:** With `--dev` mode enabled or `--auto-create-index`, indices will
be created automatically for queries that are run that don't already match
a pre-existing query. [Read more on when and how these queries are created.]()

```js
// This automatically creates
const chat = horizon("messages");
```

Now, `chat` is a Horizon collection of documents. You can perform a
variety of operations on this collection to filter them down to the ones
you need.

This most basic operations are `.store` and `.fetch().forEach()`:

```js
// Object being stored
let message = {
  text: "What a beautiful horizon ðŸŒ„!",
  datetime: new Date()
  author: "@dalanmiller"
}

// Storing a document
chat.store(message);
```

To get retrieve messages from the collection we use `.fetch().forEach()`. In this case `.forEach` takes a result and error handler function:

```js
chat.fetch().forEach(
  // Each result from the chat collection
  //  will pass through this function
  (item) => {
    console.log(item);
  },
  // If an error occurs it this function
  //  will execute with the `err` message
  (err) => {
    console.log(err);
  })  
```

Let's pretend we are building a simple chat application where
the messages are displayed in ascending order. Here are some basic
functions that would allow you to build such an app.

```js

let chats = [];

// Retrieve all messages from the server
const retrieveMessages = () => {
  chat.order('datetime')
  // fetch all results as an array, rather than one at a time
  .fetch().toArray()
  // Retrieval successful, update our model
  .forEach((newChats) => {
      chats = chats.concat(newChats);
    },
    // Error handler
    error => console.log(error),
    // onCompleted handler
    () => console.log('All results received!')
    )
};

// Retrieve an single item by id
const retrieveMessage = id => {
  chat.find(id).fetch()
    // Retrieval successful
    .forEach(result => {
      chats.push(result);
    },
    // Error occurred
    error => console.log(error))
};

// Store new item
const storeMessage = (message) => {
   chat.store(message)
    .forEach( // forEach is an alias of .subscribe
      // Returns id of saved objects
      result => console.log(result),
      // Returns server error message
      error => console.log(error)
    )
};

// Replace item that has equal `id` field
//  or insert if it doesn't exist.
const updateMessage = message => {
  chat.replace(message);
};

// Remove item from collection
const deleteMessage = message => {
  chat.remove(message);
};
```

And lastly, the `.watch` method basically creates a listener on the chat collection. Using just `chat.watch()`, and the new updated results will be pushed to you any time they change on the server. You can also `.watch` changes on a query or a single document.


```js

chat.watch().forEach(chats => {
  // Each time through it will returns all results of your query
    renderChats(allChats)
  },

  // When error occurs on server
  error => console.log(error),
)
```

You can also get notifications when the client connects and disconnects from the server

``` js
  // Triggers when client successfully connects to server
  horizon.onConnected().forEach(() => console.log("Connected to Horizon Server"))

  // Triggers when disconnected from server
  horizon.onDisconnected().forEach(() => console.log("Disconnected from Horizon Server"))
```
